 The code finds the maximum element in each subarray of size k in an array.
 Let's go through the code step by step to understand it: 1.
 The function `testCase()` takes input for n and k (the size of the array and subarray respectively).
 - It creates a vector `a` of size n to store the elements of the array.
 - Then, it loops through each element of the array and reads its value using `cin`.
 The input values are stored in the vector `a`.
 - A deque (`dq`) is created to keep track of indices.
 A deque is used because it supports efficient insertion and deletion operations from both ends.
 - Next, a loop runs from 0 to n-1 (denoted by variable `i`) to iterate over each element in the array.
 - Inside the loop, we check if the front element of deque (`dq.front()`) equals `(i-k)`.
 If it does, it means that index has moved out of range and needs to be removed from the deque using `dq.pop_front()`.
 - In every iteration, we pop elements from the back until either deque becomes empty or we find an element greater than or equal to the current element (`a[i]`).
 The idea here is to maintain a descending ordered sequence within deque where front always contains maximum value so far.
 - After that, we push the current index (`i`) into deque (`dq.push_back(i)`).
 - Finally, if `(i + 1 >= k)`, which means at least `k` elements are available, then output `a[dq.front()]`, which is guaranteed to be maximum value in current subarray since all smaller values have been discarded

 #2
This is a C++ code that solves a problem using the concept of sliding window maximum.
 First, the code includes the necessary libraries for input/output and algorithmic operations.
 Then, the main function begins by disabling the synchronization between cin/cout with scanf/printf for faster I/O operations.
 The code reads an integer t which represents the number of test cases.
 Inside a while loop that runs for t times, it reads two integers n and k representing the size of an array and the length of the sliding window respectively.
 Then, it reads n elements into an array 'a'.
 A deque data structure is used to simulate a window of size k. The deque keeps track of indices as we slide through the array 'a'.
 The maximum element in each window is found by comparing against previous windows' values.
 To start, we fill up the deque with indices from 0 to k-1, and initialize a variable 'ans' with INT_MIN (smallest possible value for int) since we want to maximize this value.
 For each iteration in the while loop, we output 'ans' followed by a space (this outputs all maximum elements so far).
 Then we enter another loop starting from k until n-1 and do some computations Inside this second loop: - We push_back (add at end) i (current index) in dq.
 - ans is updated to be max(ans, a[i]) so that if current element is greater than already found maxs then assigned indexed in sqube[0] dataset node.
 The last line does nothing currently except closing brackets incorrectly(previous authors typo not mine!
 After exiting both loops (i.e., processing all indices), one iteration or test case ends so next occurs as
 The code compiles and runs as expected.
 The code creates an integer array of size n, initializes it to the value INT_MIN, and iterates over the array while calling a function that calculates the maximum value in the array.
 The function returns this maximum value as an integer value.
