Sure, I'll try to explain how the algorithm works. The program is written in C++ and it is supposed to find the number of pairs of elements in an array that have a sum equal to a given value k.

The main steps of the algorithm are:

1. Read the number of test cases T and loop through them.
2. For each test case, read the size of the array n and the value of k.
3. Create a vector of integers a with size n and read its elements from the input.
4. Sort the vector a in ascending order using the `sort` function from the `<algorithm>` header.
5. Initialize a long long variable ans to store the answer and set it to zero.
6. Loop through the vector a from index 0 to n-1, and for each element a[i], do the following:
    - Use the `upper_bound` and `lower_bound` functions from the `<algorithm>` header to find the range of elements in a that have a value equal to k - a[i]. These functions return iterators pointing to the first element that is greater than or not less than the given value, respectively¹².
    - Subtract the lower bound iterator from the upper bound iterator to get the number of elements that have a value equal to k - a[i], and add this number to ans.
7. Print ans as the final answer for this test case.

Here is an example of how the algorithm works on a sample input:

```
Input:
1
6 10
5 1 6 8 10 14

Output:
2
```

Explanation:

- There is only one test case, so T = 1.
- The size of the array is n = 6 and the value of k is 10.
- The vector a is [5, 1, 6, 8, 10, 14] after reading from the input.
- After sorting, the vector a becomes [1, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14].
- The variable ans is initialized to zero.
- The loop starts from i = 0 and ends at i = n-1 = 5.
    - When i = 0, a[i] = 1. We need to find how many elements in a have a value equal to k - a[i] = 10 - 1 = 9. Using `upper_bound` and `lower_bound`, we get that there are no such elements, so we add zero to ans.
    - When i = 1, a[i] = 5. We need to find how many elements in a have a value equal to k - a[i] = 10 - 5 = 5. Using `upper_bound` and `lower_bound`, we get that there is one such element at index 1, so we add one to ans.
    - When i = 2, a[i] = 6. We need to find how many elements in a have a value equal to k - a[i] = 10 - 6 = 4. Using `upper_bound` and `lower_bound`, we get that there are no such elements, so we add zero to ans.
    - When i = 3, a[i] = 8. We need to find how many elements in a have a value equal to k - a[i] = 10 - 8 = 2. Using `upper_bound` and `lower_bound`, we get that there are no such elements, so we add zero to ans.
    - When i = 4, a[i] = 10. We need to find how many elements in a have a value equal to k - a[i] = 10 - 10 = 0. Using `upper_bound` and `lower_bound`, we get that there are no such elements, so we add zero to ans.
    - When i = 5, a[i] = 14. We need to find how many elements in a have a value equal to k - a[i] = 10 - 14 = -4. Using `upper_bound` and `lower_bound`, we get that there are no such elements, so we add zero to ans.
- The final answer is ans = **2**, which is printed as output.
